The goal is to understand pricing, ratings, and data quality before further analysis.

## Objectives
- Inspect dataset structure
- Clean and prepare data
- Analyze book prices and ratings
- Visualize distributions and trends
- Explore scraped book pricing data, understand the distribution of prices, and identify potential patterns 


## Tools Used
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Key Findings
- Average book price calculated
- Price distribution visualized
- Rating frequency analyzed

## Files
- `eda_books.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with full analysis
- `books.csv` – Dataset used
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies

## Exploratory Data Analysis

This analysis explores scraped book pricing data to understand price distribution and variability.

### Key Findings
- Book prices range from approximately £14 to £57
- The distribution is slightly right-skewed
- No missing values were found after cleaning
- The cleaned dataset is suitable for SQL analysis and dashboard visualization
